## How to Replace Placeholders:

1. Create or capture screenshots of your actual projects
2. Save them with the exact filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `/images/` folder
4. The website will automatically display your images

## Alternative Image Sources:

If you don't have project screenshots yet, you can use:
- Mockups from design tools like Canva (which you know!)
- Stock images from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/)
- Placeholder services like Lorem Picsum (https://picsum.photos/)
- Create simple graphics representing your projects

For now, the images will show broken image icons, but the layout will work perfectly once you add your actual images.
