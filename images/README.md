# Image Placeholder Instructions

This folder contains placeholder references for the portfolio images. 

## Required Images:

1. **profile.jpg** - Your professional profile picture (400x400px recommended)
2. **project1.jpg** - E-Commerce Website screenshot
3. **project2.jpg** - Student Management System screenshot  
4. **project3.jpg** - Weather App screenshot
5. **project4.jpg** - Portfolio Website screenshot
6. **project5.jpg** - Task Manager screenshot
7. **project6.jpg** - Calculator App screenshot

## Image Guidelines:

- **Profile Picture**: Professional headshot, square format (400x400px)
- **Project Images**: Screenshots of your actual projects (350x200px recommended)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Quality**: High resolution but optimized for web

## How to Replace Placeholders:

1. Take screenshots of your actual projects
2. Save them with the exact filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `/images/` folder
4. The website will automatically display your images

## Alternative Image Sources:

If you don't have project screenshots yet, you can use:
- Mockups from design tools like Figma
- Stock images from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/)
- Placeholder services like Lorem Picsum (https://picsum.photos/)

For now, the images will show broken image icons, but the layout will work perfectly once you add your actual images.
